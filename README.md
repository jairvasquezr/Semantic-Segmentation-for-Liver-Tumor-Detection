# Semantic-Segmentation-for-Liver-Tumor-Detection
This project applies the SegFormer model for semantic segmentation of liver and tumor regions in CT scans, using the LiTS (Liver Tumor Segmentation) dataset. It includes dataset preprocessing, training, and inference pipelines, along with reproducible code and pretrained checkpoints.
